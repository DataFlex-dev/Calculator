# Calculator Library

With the new Calculator Library you can embed a popup calculator in your DataFlex applications without opening one in Windows or on your phone! Enter an expression or calculate a result with the in-app keypad, click OK and the result will automatically be placed directly in your (db)Form or c(db)CJGridColumn cell.

The Calculator Library contains packages, an icon and a demo program for testing.
